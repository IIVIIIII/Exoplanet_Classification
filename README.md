# machine-learning-challenge

This project involves training two separate machine learning models to classify exoplanet canidates identified by the Kepler Space Observatory as 'CONFIRMED', 'FALSE POSITIVE', or 'CANDIDATE'.

One model uses sklearn's random forest classifier and the other uses sklearn's support vector classifier (SVC). Both models undergo hyperparameter tuning using sklearn's GridSearchCV.
